Easy to add panes on a tradingview chart using whatever coding language. The example in this case is with python, but the idea is that you can code your strategy or indicators in any language.

Hey!

This is an easy fix to plot whatever indicators you want on a tradingview chart.

You can run it localy, and the only thing you need is to render the json data through the app.py file on the tradingview chart which is the index and main files.

The tricky part is the main function within strategy.py but I think you guys will figure it out.
